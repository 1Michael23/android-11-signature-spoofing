# Info

This script automatically pulls the services.jar from your android device, Patches it with Haystack for android 11, and then compiles it back into a flashable magisk module.

# Warning!

If ADB is not enabled, or fails to find the services.jar file, this script may produce a bootloop causing magisk module, (if you dont know how to resolve this from the recovery, use the manual installation)
